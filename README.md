# Crystallize Apps

Here we manage all of the Crystallize Apps.

In order to simplify their maintenance they are all in this Git Repository.

All contributions will happen here:

-   PRs and Issues are therefore open, discuss, contribute in one place
-   Many things will be shared accross the `components`: Coding Standards, CI & Automations, Tests, etc.

âœ… Nevertheless, all the `components` will continue to be independant and pushed in their own repository. (through magic mechanisms that we have internally)
